                        Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Absolutely! This is a great trip for children of all ages. However, we have found that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more (and parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly, we deal with very few bored children of any age! The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling crazy stories...some of which are even true!

                        Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears a coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins, explaining what you should prepare for and what to do in the event that you fall out of the raft.

                        What is included in the trip?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair.
                                We provided water and lemonade during the day. Hot chocolate is provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in.

                                The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the canyon is to be prepared for both hot and dry as well as cold and wet. Here's some of out recommendations for an extended trip:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Rain jacket and rain pants: We don't recommend ponchos as they can easily be ripped or lost in harsh water conditions.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Hats: A large brim hat offers protection from the sun. Make sure to have a good quality strap!
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Sunglasses: Highly recommended. Again, these are best with a strap!
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Socks: used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Sandals or water shoes: If not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked in before.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Camper Wear: Bring something comfortable to wear around camp. Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs are all popular options.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Sleep Wear: You might choose to sleep in your camp wear. Otherwise, you might like to bring something comfortable to sleep in.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Addtional Items: Water bottle, small day pack for hikes, moisturizing lotion, headlamp or flashlight, moleskin, waterproof sunscreen, lip balm gloves, fleece jacket, towel, bandana, small pillow, hygiene products (i.e. toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, extra eyeglasses or contacts, biodegradable soap and shampoo), personal items (i.e. camera, equipment book, watercolors, journal and pen)
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?        
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Are you kidding me?! What isn't great about whitewater rafting!! Let's describe a typical day on the river.
                            Get up in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How far in advance should I book my trip?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking 4-6 months in advance. If you can be more flexible 2 months in advance is usually sufficient.
